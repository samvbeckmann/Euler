# Project Euler Solutions
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here. Spoilers ahead.

## Solutions
The contents of this repository are solutions to Project Euler problems.
They are written in a variety of languages, mostly in Java or Python though.
Some of the solutions are from my early days in programming, and could use
some updating. I might get around to that eventually, but most likely will
work on new and interesting problems instead.
